\## Proposal: Improve Error Messages \& User Feedback



\### What

Enhance error messages and feedback shown to users during common actions such as login, signup, and failed requests. This includes clearer text, consistent styling, and simple guidance on what to do next.



\### Why

Unclear or generic error messages can confuse users. Improving feedback will make the application easier to understand, reduce user frustration, and improve overall user experience.



\### Scope

Small
